# NLP-Understanding-Text
Now we are getting into interesting and fun parts of NLP. This is where we really start to apply what we've been learning. In this next stage of our NLP journey, we move from tokenizing and tagging to organizing, categorizing, and analyzing structured language data. These chapters from the NLTK book introduce some powerful concepts and tools, and this post will guide you through the big ideas with beginner-friendly examples and insights.

# Extracting Information from Text
By now, you've seen how we can break text into tokens and even label those tokens with parts of speech. But what if we want to go a step further? Like extracting names, dates, or relationships?

This is what Chapter 7 is all about: Information Extraction (IE).

In everyday NLP applications (like digital assistants or resume parsers), we often want to extract structured data from unstructured text. Chapter 7 gives us the basics for that.y
Named Entity Recognition (NER)
Named entities are "proper names" like:

People: “Elon Musk”

Organizations: “NASA”

Locations: “Mount Everest”

In NLTK, you can identify named entities like this:

    import nltk
    
    from nltk import word_tokenize, pos_tag, ne_chunk
    
    sentence = "Barack Obama was born in Hawaii and became the President of the United States."
    tokens = word_tokenize(sentence)
    tagged = pos_tag(tokens)
    entities = ne_chunk(tagged)
    entities.draw()
This will pop up a tree that labels:

“Barack Obama” as a PERSON

“Hawaii” as a GPE (Geo-Political Entity)

“United States” as GPE as well

You can explore it like a family tree: each subtree under NE (Named Entity) groups the tokens it found together as part of a single named entity.

Why This Matters:

  Named Entity Recognition is used in:
  
  News aggregators (finding people, places, events)
  
  Search engines
  
  Customer service chatbots

It’s a core step in turning raw text into searchable or analyzable information.

# Analyzing Sentence Structure
This section dives into grammar. Not the grammar you might remember from school—but a formal, programmable system that lets computers parse sentences and understand structure.

NLTK provides context-free grammars (CFGs) that define which sentence structures are valid. Think of it as a recipe that defines which words and phrases go where.

Writing a Simple Grammar

    from nltk import CFG    
    grammar = CFG.fromstring("""
      S -> NP VP
      NP -> Det N
      VP -> V NP
      Det -> 'the'
      N -> 'cat' | 'dog'
      V -> 'chased' | 'saw'
    """)

This defines a very basic structure:

A Sentence (S) consists of a Noun Phrase and a Verb Phrase

A Noun Phrase has a determiner and a noun (like "the dog")

A Verb Phrase has a verb and a noun phrase

Parsing Sentences
You can parse a sentence with a recursive descent parser:
    
    from nltk.parse import RecursiveDescentParser
    parser = RecursiveDescentParser(grammar)
    for tree in parser.parse(['the', 'dog', 'chased', 'the', 'cat']):
        tree.pretty_print()

Why Sentence Parsing Matters

Parsing is used in:

  Machine translation
  
  Question answering systems
  
  Grammar correction

It helps computers not just read text, but understand relationships—like who did what to whom.

# Building Feature-Based Classifiers
This section introduces text classification using features. The big idea: We can build a machine learning model that looks at features of text (like word presence, word length, POS tags, etc.) and makes a decision — Is this spam or not? Is this positive or negative?

#Features in NLP

A feature is a piece of information extracted from text that might help us distinguish between classes.

For example, let’s say we’re trying to classify movie reviews as "positive" or "negative". A feature might be:

Does the word "great" appear?

How many exclamation marks are used?

Is the word "boring" missing?

In NLTK, a simple feature extractor might look like this:
    
    def review_features(words):
        return {'contains(love)': 'love' in words}

Then we can train a classifier:

    from nltk.classify import apply_features
    from nltk.corpus import movie_reviews
    import random
    
    documents = [(list(movie_reviews.words(fileid)), category)
                 for category in movie_reviews.categories()
                 for fileid in movie_reviews.fileids(category)]
    
    random.shuffle(documents)
    featuresets = [(review_features(d), c) for (d, c) in documents]
    
    from nltk.classify import NaiveBayesClassifier
    train_set, test_set = featuresets[100:], featuresets[:100]
    classifier = NaiveBayesClassifier.train(train_set)
    
    print(nltk.classify.accuracy(classifier, test_set))
    classifier.show_most_informative_features(5)

This gives you a basic Naive Bayes classifier trained on movie reviews. It uses word presence as the feature and shows which words are most “informative” (strong predictors of category).

Why It’s Important

Classification is foundational to:

  Spam detection
  
  Sentiment analysis
  
  Fake news detection
  
  Language detection

Once you understand features, you can start experimenting with improving accuracy, combining multiple types of features, or using advanced classifiers like decision trees or neural networks. With the knowledge gained here, and some other simple examples that can be found in the NLTK textbook, We should be able to start Running through And analyzing our own texts at least at a simple level, further along instead of Just taking each sentence individually and pulling out simple grammar from it, now we have the power to Ask ourselves and answer the questions of what is the message behind this piece of text? Or, What is the feeling behind this text or many entries of text? This is why we call it sentiment analysis and the greater uses of this today to automate processing a lot of text such as online reviews or comments or chats as the manual process far more laborious than we have time to do. These are the building blocks for search engines or chat bots, two of the most widely used tools on the Internet today but each model is unique and can be trained, there's no one perfect model. But once a model is trained, It can be used again, this is why we train little and store lots.
